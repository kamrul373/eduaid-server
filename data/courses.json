Building fullstack applications (i.e. frontend + backend) with the MERN stack is very popular - in this course, you will learn it from scratch at the example of a complete project!MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js - and combined, these four technologies allow you to build amazing web applications. In this course, we'll build an entire project and you will learn how these different technologies work together step by step. We'll first have a look at all the individual building blocks, so that we then can also combine them all into one amazing application by the end of the course."
